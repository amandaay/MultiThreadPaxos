# Assignment Overview

This assignment aims to bolster the fault tolerance of a Key-Value Store Server by implementing the Paxos consensus algorithm. In the previous Project #3, the system relied on a two-phase commit protocol for consistency across replicas but lacked resilience to faults. Project #4 shifts the focus to integrating Paxos for fault-tolerant consensus among replicated servers. The task involves implementing Paxos roles (Proposers, Acceptors, and Learners) and ensuring continuous operation of the KV-store despite replica failures. Acceptors are intentionally set to "fail" at random intervals, demonstrating how Paxos deals with replicated server failures.

# Technical Impression
The assignment delves into a detailed implementation of the Paxos consensus algorithm within a distributed system. The Java code covers the creation of Paxos servers, handling client requests, and simulating acceptor failures. Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is used for communication between distributed components. The implementation showcases a solid understanding of Paxos, defining roles for proposers, acceptors, and learners.

Randomness is introduced to simulate failures, providing a practical demonstration of how Paxos copes with faults. Threading is used to simulate failures and restart acceptor threads, illustrating Paxos' resilience.

On the client side, the code enables user interaction, supporting operations like GET, PUT, and DELETE. The successful integration of Paxos into the existing Key-Value Store Server significantly improves its fault tolerance. To enhance the assignment, additional comments could explain key aspects of the Paxos algorithm and the rationale behind design decisions. Expanding the executive summary would offer a clearer overview of the assignment's goals and achievements. In conclusion, the implementation demonstrates a strong understanding of distributed systems and consensus algorithms.
